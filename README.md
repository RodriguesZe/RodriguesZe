# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am ZÃ© Rodrigues, proudly born in Madeira Island, but currently living in Lisbon, ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹. A backend developer at heart, working primarily with PHP (no, it's not dead at all). Also, a big fan of ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-FF2D20?style=for-the-badge&logo=laravel&logoColor=white)! I'm currently trying to learn a thing or two about DevOps. 

## Fun Fact
As any ZÃ© will tell you, one of the biggest challenges of this Portuguese name, in an international environment, is to help everyone on how to pronounce my name. From "Z" to "Zey", the fun never ends.
